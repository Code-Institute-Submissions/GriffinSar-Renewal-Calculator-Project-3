# Sales Calculator

### Purpose
The purpose of this site is to provide the user with pricing for their renewal quotes. It has specifically created for renewal representitives who work for Quest Software. They input some details: the price, level and product and the system will provide them with the new pricing for this years quote. They can also choose to get the pricing for a 2 year and 3 year quote so they can easily provide all options to the customer.
This program also stores the customer data so that the user can access previous quote prices for their reference. 
The purpose of this site is to streamline the renewal process for these sales representitives. Many of thier quotes need to be manually priced so this site can help them to work out the pricing of a quote in a more efficient way.

# Target Audience
The Target Audience for this website is sales reps specifically the sales reps who work for my current employer Quest software. These reps have a number of manual calculatitons that needs to be done to prepare a quote for their customer, this has to be done for thousands of quotes every three months. Part of my role in the past was to price these quotes for the reps. There is a definate need here for something that makes the process easier and more streamlined. This app is designed to take away some of this manual work so that the sales rep can concentrate on selling the products to the customer rather than focusing so much time on administration work.
This is the sort of functionality that many CRM systems implement to streamline quoting for customers.
